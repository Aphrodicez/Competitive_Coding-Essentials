1252. Cells with Odd Values in a Matrix
There is an m x n matrix that is initialized to all 0's. There is also a 2D array indices where each indices[i] = [ri, ci] represents a 0-indexed location to perform some increment operations on the matrix.

For each location indices[i], do both of the following:

1. Increment all the cells on row ri.
2. Increment all the cells on column ci.

Given m, n, and indices, return the number of odd-valued cells in the matrix after applying the increment to all locations in indices.

Constraints:

1 <= m, n <= 50
1 <= indices.length <= 100
0 <= ri < m
0 <= ci < n
 

Follow up: Could you solve this in O(n + m + indices.length) time with only O(n + m) extra space?
